Customer Churn Prediction- It is  machine learning model where i have  used various machine learning algorithm to predict customers with a high churn risk. The main objective of my project is to demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged allowing the bank to proactively take steps to improve customer satisfaction and retention. 
Analysis- I have created a dashboard using Microsoft power-bi project. The dashboard serves as a single-page representation of reports derived from various datasets.
